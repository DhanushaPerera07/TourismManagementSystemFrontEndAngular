Sri Lanka is one of the most popular destinations for travelers. 
So, there are so many foreigners' visits, Sri Lanka, all the time. 
As a result of that the tourism industry is popular in Sri Lanka. 
This particular company is an inbound tourism company that manages all the accommodations,
places to visit, and many more to visitors.
Currently, they are using the not efficient and time-consuming method to manage their tour packages. 
 
So, they wanted a system that can manage tours, get the total cost, and calculate the profit at the same time. 
It would be great if they have an internal system to do all the things that they expect. 
So, this project is a solution to their current method.
